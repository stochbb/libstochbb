/** \page mem Memory Management
 * The classes in StochBB are separated into two groups API are all classes intended to be
 * used by other software using libstochbb, while all remainnig classes should
 * only be used within libstochbb. Dividing them into two groups provides two advantages: (a) The
 * API is well defined and clean. It does not contain any interface that is intended to be
 * used by thrid-party-software. And (b), it allows to implement everything in terms of actual
 * objects and containers. The "objects" do the voodoo while containers provide the intended API and
 * manage "objects". This allows to implement some automatc memmory management and the user does not
 * need to deal with it.

 * Almost all classes of the API are derived from the @c Container class. This class implements a
 * simple reference counting which ensures that any @c Object being held in a container by the
 * user will never be freed. As objects may reference other object, a simple mark and sweep garbage
 * collector is implemented too, which searches for unreachable objects that are not held in a
 * container and frees them.
 *
 * Therefore, when extending libstochbb, two basic rules must be considered:
 *   -# Never pass around an @c Object directly. Only pass around @c Container. This ensures that
 *      the object referenced by the Container is freed although being used.
 *   -# Never store containers in an @c Object. This rule ensures that there are no circular
 *      references which will result in a memory leak.
 *
 * Following these rules will ensure that now @c Object is freed while beeing used and all
 * unreachable Objects are freed.

/** @defgroup internal Internal used objects and functions.
 * This group collects all classes and functions that are not directly accessible through the API.
 * These objects are derived from the basic @c stochbb::Object class wich implements the reference
 * counting and interfaces for the mark & sweep grabage collector. All classes documented here are only of
 * interest if you want to understand the implementation of StochBB or if you want to extend it. */
