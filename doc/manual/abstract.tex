\pkg{StochBB} is a sofware framework and a graphical user interface program that allows to analyze
complex systems of dependent random variables efficiently. For example, such networks are 
frequently used to describe cognitive processes and are usually analyzed by means of Monte Carlo
type stochastic simulations. Although very flexible, the stochastic simulation approach requires a
large number of samples to be drawn, to obtain reliable statistics for the response variable of
interest. In contrast to stochastic simulation, \pkg{StochBB} derives the marginal distributions of
dependent random variables analytically and resorts to numerical solutions whenever the analytic
approach fails. To achieve this,  \pkg{StochBB} implements a rudimentary computer algebra system
for systems of dependent random variables. As an example, we analyze a simple cognitive model that
with a divergence point.
