 * \section intro Introduction
 * Frequently, complex systems are described in terms of stochastic processes. Either as the
 * underlaying deterministic process is simply too complex to be modelled exactly or as the
 * process is indeed random. The most simple class of random processes are the stationay processes.
 * There the process parameters do not change in time and the process can be described as a simple
 * random variable. StochBB can be used to describe and analyze complex stationary random processes
 * in time by combining simple processes (described by a known waiting-time distribution) to
 * complex processes.
